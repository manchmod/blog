I'm Greg. This is my blog, there are many like it, but this one is mine.

Im guessing this will be sparsely populated, but the idea is to have a place to write about what I'm working on. I have a background in information security, DevOps, networking, reverse engineering, and systems architecture.


There is a companion site for this one which has more technical documentation and reference material at [docs.notch.org](https://docs.notch.org) .
